# Mini Projects â€“ April to May 2025

This folder contains mini-projects built to apply my Python knowledge in real-world scenarios. These projects combine logic, user input, data handling, and visualization using Pandas and Matplotlib.

## Projects Included:
- Grade analysis with CSV & Pandas
- Data visualization from external sources
- File handling and project-based logic (e.g., Budget Tracker)
- Fun utilities like To-Do list & Password Generator

These projects mark a major step in my journey from basic practice to applied coding.
