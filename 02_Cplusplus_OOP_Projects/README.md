# C++ OOP Projects â€“ Jan to Feb 2025

This folder contains my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) projects in C++ built during Janâ€“Feb 2025. These projects helped me practice real-world modeling using classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and file handling.

## ðŸŒŸ Topics Covered:

- Classes and Objects  
- Constructors and Destructors  
- Friend Functions  
- Inheritance (Single, Multilevel)  
- Polymorphism (Function Overloading)  
- File Handling

## ðŸ’» Project Files:

- `class_student.cpp`: Basic class with data input/output  
- `bank_account_class.cpp`: Simulates simple banking system  
- `distance_calculator.cpp`: Friend function to calculate distance  
- `employee_inheritance.cpp`: Inheritance with employee types  
- `shape_area_polymorphism.cpp`: Function overloading for shape areas  
- `constructor_example.cpp`: Constructor and destructor example  
- `student_record_file_handling.cpp`: Student data with file operations
